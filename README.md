I'm thrilled to showcase my 2nd data analytics project! I leveraged my Tableau skills to design a dashboard that simulates emergency room visits - a project that I would be tasked with as a Healthcare Data Analyst. In general, analyzing visits / customer traffic is widely applicable in several fields of analytics that deals with improving client services.

### ❓ Defining the Question:

- How can the hospital maximize efficiency in Emergency Department operations in order to improve patient outcomes and satisfaction?

- It is vital to understand areas of improvement and derive insights on wait times and satisfaction scores since we are dealing with an emergency room and people's lives are at stake.

### 📌 Objective:

- Analyze emergency room (ER) visit data by constructing visualizations with the aim to maximize operational efficiency and patient satisfaction. I delved into ER visit data, examining relevant variables and constructing interactive graphs. 📉

- The main variables are: number of patients visiting ER (total number of all patients subdivided by percentage of gender), average wait time by months (line graph), average patient satisfaction by months (line graph), number of patients by age in emergency department (area chart), patient race (bar graph), average wait time (heat map), and department referral (bar graph). 📊

### ✍ Data Collection:

- I used a RWFD (real world fake data) dataset from data.world. RWFD is useful for healthcare analytics projects as hospitals are not keen on sharing sensitive data and publicizing confidential patient information would be a HIPAA violation. Both of which make finding clinical datasets tricky for healthcare data analytics projects. Nonetheless, I found the perfect dataset as I am able to simulate a real hospital environment.

### 🔍 Data Analysis:

1️⃣ 𝘗𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘍𝘭𝘰𝘸: By monitoring monthly ER visits by gender and race, I identified peak periods, enabling resource allocation to effectively meet demand while better understanding our patient demographics. 📅

2️⃣ 𝘌𝘧𝘧𝘪𝘤𝘪𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘺: Analyzing average wait time revealed trends in busy days and times as well as bottlenecks, guiding process improvements to minimize patient wait times. ⏰

3️⃣ 𝘗𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘚𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘴𝘧𝘢𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯: Correlating satisfaction scores with wait time and demographics highlighted insights on similarities and differences in patient happiness by age, race, gender, and time. 👍
